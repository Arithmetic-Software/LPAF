# Documentation
Here you can find all the documentation. It is actively worked on and being updated as changes are being made to GAFW.

There are three directories here:
- External (symbol reference for symbols that the user can use)
- Internal (symbol reference for symbols only used within the framework)
- Guides (tutorials and such)

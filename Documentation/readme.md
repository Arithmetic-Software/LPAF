**WORK IN PROGRESS**<br>
Because things are still changing in a rapid manner, information may be outdated even before changes are published here.
# Documentation
Here you can find all the documentation. It is actively worked on and being updated as changes are being made to LPAF.

There are three directories here:
- External (symbol reference, normal usage)
- Internal (framework internal, if you know what you are doing)
- Guides (tutorials and such)

**WORK IN PROGRESS**<br>
Because things are still changing in a rapid manner, information may be outdated even before changes are published to this repository.
# Documentation
Here you can find all the documentation. It is actively worked on and being updated as changes are being made to LPAF.

There are three directories here:
- External (symbol reference for symbols that the user can use, normal usage)
- Internal (symbol reference for symbols only used within the framework, advanced usage)
- Guides (tutorials and such)

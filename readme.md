The Lightweight and Performant Application Framework (LPAF) is really just what the name says, a 
framework for development of performance-critical application.

## My Goal
Many frameworks that are currently available either disregard runtime performance or let the 
developer do ludicrous amounts of work configuring how the software should behave. Some others are
so old to the point where outdated practices are being used which further hinder performance and
usability.

LPAF attempts to solve that problem by focusing on ease-of-use, a modern coding style and overhead
low procedures. At its core, LPAF is abstracting OS-level API interactions with some flavor on top. 
This makes LPAF perfect any performance, resource or time critical application. 

## Documentation and Information
Documentation exists in the form of doxygen for all symbols. Guides and tutorials are provided in `doc/`.

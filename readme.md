# LPAF
The **L**ightweigt and **P**erfomant **A**pplication **F**ramwork is really just what the name says, a framework for development of performance-critical application.

### My Goal
I have noticed this trend with software development frameworks and engines lately where ease-of-use seems far too important. I am not saying that these tools are too easy to use but rather that this design philosophy can greatly hinder your controll over what the machine is doing. This introduces indirection and in the end, uncrollable overhead. LPAF attempts to solve that problem by giving the user as much controll as he wants. LPAF can hold your hand on as many thing as you want without introducing subroutines that are not immediatly neccessary. 

The end goal is to have a software development engine (this right here is only the base framework) where you have complete controll over all the components you want to manage yourself while LPAF manages everything you dont want to touch. This creates a middle ground between these low-level API's where you have to do **everything** yourself and higher-level engines where **everything** is abstacted away.

**This project is still far, far from finished and cannot possibly be used for production.**

# LPAF
The **L**ightweigt and **P**erfomant **A**pplication **F**ramwork is really just what the name says, a framework for 
development of performance-critical application.

## My Goal
I have noticed this trend with software development frameworks and engines lately where ease-of-use seems far too 
important. I am not saying that these tools are too easy to use but rather that this design philosophy can greatly 
hinder your control over what the machine is doing. This introduces indirection and in the end, uncontrollable overhead. 
LPAF attempts to solve that problem by giving the user as much control as he wants. LPAF can hold your hand on as many 
thing as you want without introducing subroutines that are not immediately necessary. 

The end goal is to have a software development engine (this right here is only the base framework) where you have 
complete control over all the components you want to manage yourself while LPAF manages everything you don't want to 
touch. This creates a middle ground between these low-level APIs where you have to do **everything** yourself and 
higher-level engines where **everything** is abstracted away.
